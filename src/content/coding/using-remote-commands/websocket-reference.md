# {{title}}

The following are Misty's available WebSocket data stream types. You can filter all WebSocket options so (a) they return only a specified subset of the data and (b) check current values before the data is sent.

**Note**: All of Misty's WebSocket data structures are subject to change.

## TimeOfFlight

Misty has four time-of-flight sensors that provide raw proximity data (in meters) in a single stream. The ```TimeOfFlight``` WebSocket sends this data any time a time-of-flight sensor is triggered. It is possible for proximity data to be sent as frequently as every 70 milliseconds, though it can be significantly slower. It is not sent at timed intervals.

Sample time-of-flight sensor data:
```javascript
TimeOfFlight{
	"EventName":"TimeOfFlight",
	"Message":{
		"Created":"2018-03-30T20:36:46.5816862Z",
		"DistanceInMeters":0.184,
		"Expiry":"2018-03-30T20:36:46.9316897Z",
		"SensorId":"CD727A0A",
		"SensorPosition":"Right"
	},
	"Type":"TimeOfFlight"
}
```

## ComputerVision (Beta)

You can subscribe to the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket to obtain data on both face detection and face recognition events.

The ```EventName``` value is the name you provide when you register the WebSocket connection.  

If face recognition is running on the robot, and a previously trained face is recognized, the ```PersonName``` value is the name previously assigned to that face. The ```PersonName``` value is ```unknown_person``` if an untrained/unknown face is detected. The ```PersonName``` value is ```null``` if face recognition is not currently running.

```TrackId``` is reserved data that may change in the future.

Sample ComputerVision data for a face recognition event:
```javascript
ComputerVision{
	"EventName":"MyFaceRecognition",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":-3,
		"Created":"2018-07-02T16:26:20.1718422Z",
		"Distance":71,
		"Elevation":3,
		"Expiry":"2018-07-02T16:26:20.9218446Z",
		"PersonName":"Barkley",
		"SensorId":null,
		"SensorName":null,
		"TrackId":0
	},
	"Type":"ComputerVision"
}
```

## FaceDetection (Deprecated)

**Note**: The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket is deprecated. Use the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket instead.

The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket returns only raw face detection data. Currently, this sensory data is not aggregated with other face data, so there may be empty and ```null``` fields.

The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket data is sent only upon a sensory message trigger. It is not sent at timed intervals. The approximate transmission rate of ```FaceDetection``` data is 4x/second, but this timing can vary.

Sample face detection data:
```javascript
FaceDetection{
	"EventName":"FaceDetection",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":-3,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T16:25:00.6934206Z",
		"Distance":71,
		"Elevation":3,
		"Expiry":"2018-04-02T16:25:01.4434254Z",
		"FaceId":3,
		"PersonName":null,
		"SensorId":null
	},
	"Type":"FaceDetection"
}
```

## FaceRecognition (Deprecated)

**Note**: The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket is deprecated. Use the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket instead.

The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket returns only raw face recognition data. Currently, this sensory data is not aggregated with other face data, so there may be empty and ```null``` fields, including the recognized name.

The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket data is sent only upon a sensory message trigger. It is not sent at timed intervals. The approximate transmission rate of ```FaceRecognition``` data is 1x/second, but this timing can vary.

Sample face recognition data:
```javascript
FaceRecognition{
	"EventName":"FaceRecognition",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":0,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T16:26:20.1718422Z",
		"Distance":0,
		"Elevation":0,
		"Expiry":"2018-04-02T16:26:20.9218446Z",
		"FaceId":12,
		"PersonName":"Barkley",
		"SensorId":null
	},
	"Type":"FaceRecognition"
}
```

## LocomotionCommand

```LocomotionCommand``` WebSocket data is sent every time the linear or angular velocity of the robot changes. It is not sent at timed intervals.

Sample locomotion data:
```javascript
LocomotionCommand{
	"EventName":"LocomotionCommand",
	"Message":{
		"ActionId":0,
		"AngularVelocity":0,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T22:59:39.3350238Z",
		"LinearVelocity":0.30000000000000004,
		"UsePid":true,
		"UseTrapezoidalDrive":true,
		"ValueIndex":0
	},
	"Type":"LocomotionCommand"
}
```

## HaltCommand

```HaltCommand``` WebSocket data is sent every time the robot stops and contains the date and time of the event. It is not sent at timed intervals.

## SelfState

The ```SelfState``` WebSocket provides a variety of data about Misty’s current internal state, including:

* battery charge, voltage, and charging status
* IP address
* affect
* position and orientation ("pose")
* SLAM status
* sensor messages

**Note:** There are a number of fields in the WebSocket data structure that are reserved for future use and which may be empty or contain ```null``` data:
* ```Acceleration```
* ```BumpedState```
* ```CurrentGoal```
* ```MentalState```
* ```Personality```
* ```PhysiologicalBehavior```

```SelfState``` WebSocket messages are sent even if the data has not changed, as the data is sent via timed updates, instead of being triggered by events. The ```SelfState``` WebSocket can send data as frequently as every 100ms, though it is set by default to 250ms. To avoid having to handle excess data, you can change the message frequency for the WebSocket with the ```DebounceMs``` field, as shown in the ```lightSocket.js``` JavaScript helper.

Sample SelfState data:
```javascript
SelfState {
    "eventName": "SelfState",
    "message": {
        "acceleration": null,
        "batteryChargePercent": 0,
        "batteryVoltage": 0,

## WorldState

The ```WorldState``` WebSocket sends data about the environment Misty is perceiving, including:
* the locations of perceived objects
* the times they were perceived

```WorldState``` WebSocket messages are sent even if the data has not changed, as the data is sent via timed updates, instead of being triggered by events. The ```WorldState``` WebSocket can send data as frequently as every 100ms, though it is set by default to 250ms. To avoid having to handle excess data, you can change the message frequency for the WebSocket with the ```DebounceMs``` field, as shown in the ```lightSocket.js``` JavaScript helper.

## BatteryCharge
The `BatteryCharge` data stream provides information about the state of Misty's battery, including charge percentage, voltage, and charging status. The `BatteryCharge` data stream sends messages at timed intervals of five seconds.

Sample `BatteryCharge` data:

```JSON
BatteryCharge {
    "eventName":"BatteryCharge",
    "message": {
        "batteryChargePercent": 0.51,
        "created": "2019-01-09T19:18:53.3921197Z",
        "currentVoltage": 6.949,
        "expiry": "2019-01-09T19:19:03.3921197Z",
        "isCharging": false,
        "sensorId": "charge",
        "sensorName": null
    },
    "type":"BatteryCharge"
}
```

## ActuatorPosition

**Available for Misty II only**

The `ActuatorPosition` data stream provides information about the position of the actuators responsible for controlling the movement of Misty's head and arms. `ActuatorPosition` data is sent at timed intervals you define when you register for `ActuatorPosition` messages.

In the `ActuatorPosition` data object, the value of the `sensorName` property is the name of the actuator you are receiving information about (`Actuator_HeadPitch`, `Actuator_HeadYaw`, `Actuator_HeadRoll`, `Actuator_LeftArm`, or `Actuator_RightArm`).  The value property holds a number indicating the position of the actuator (in radians).

`Note:` When you subscribe to the `ActuatorPosition` data stream, you should specify which actuator you want to receive messages about. For example, the following code from a local skill shows how to use a property comparison test to get data from the sensor for the actuator responsible for controlling the movement of Misty's right arm:

```JavaScript
// Register for ActuatorPosition data for the actuator for Misty's right arm
misty.AddPropertyTest("ActuatorPosition", "sensorName", "==", "Actuator_RightArm", "string");
misty.RegisterEvent("ActuatorPosition", "ActuatorPosition", 1000, true);

// Callback function that triggers each time ActuatorPosition data is sent
function _ActuatorPosition(data) {
// Do something with the data
}
```

Sample `ActuatorPosition` data:

```JSON
ActuatorPosition {
    "eventName": "ActuatorPosition",
    "message": {
        "actuatorId": "NBQEA0",
        "created": "2019-01-09T20:15:38.0870356Z",
        "expiry": "2019-01-09T20:15:39.0870356Z", 
        "sensorId": "ala",
        "sensorName": "Actuator_LeftArm",
        "value":-5.09
    },
    "type":"ActuatorPosition"
}
```

## BumpSensor
**Available for Misty II only**

The `BumpSensor` data stream sends information each time one of the bump sensors on Misty's base is pressed or released. In the `BumpSensor` data object, the value of the `sensorName` property is the name of the bump sensor that triggered the event (`Bump_FrontRight`, `Bump_FrontLeft`, `Bump_RearRight`, or `Bump_RearLeft`). The value of the `isContacted` property is a boolean indicating whether the bump sensor was pressed (`true`) or released (`false`).The `BumpSensor` data object also provides “pose” information about Misty at the time of the event. For more about pose, see the [mapping section of the API Explorer documentation](../../../onboarding/apps/api-explorer/#mapping-amp-tracking-alpha). 

For an example that shows how to register for and use data from `BumpSensor` events in a local skill, see the [Bump Sensors skill tutorial](../../../coding/using-local-skills/tutorials/#bump-sensors-misty-ii-).

Sample `BumpSensor` data:

```JSON
BumpSensor {
    "eventName": "BumpSensor",
    "message": {
        "created": "2019-01-09T20:32:27.1036178Z",

## DriveEncoders

**Available for Misty II only**

The `DriveEncoders` data stream provides information about the angular velocity (in radians per second) and rotation (in radians) for Misty's left and right encoders. `DriveEncoders` data is sent at timed intervals you define when you register for `DriveEncoders` messages.

Sample `DriveEncoders` sensor data:

```JSON
DriveEncoders {
    "eventName": "DriveEncoders",
    "message": {
        "created": "2019-01-09T21:39:32.0681324Z",
        "expiry": "2019-01-09T21:39:33.0681324Z", 
        "leftEncoderAngularVelocity": 0,
        "leftEncoderRotations": 0,
        "rightEncoderAngularVelocity": 1.4223481644949679e-36,
        "rightEncoderRotations": 3.430562713439764e-34,
        "sensorId": "enc",
        "sensorName": null
    },
    "type":"DriveEncoders"
}
```

## IMU

**Available for Misty II only**

The IMU data stream provides information from Misty's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor. It includes information about:
* the pitch, yaw, and roll orientation angles of the sensor (in radians)
* the force (in meters per second squared) currently applied to the sensor along its pitch, yaw, and roll rotational axes
* the force (in meters per second squared) currently applied to the sensor along its X, Y, and Z axes

By default, `IMU` data is sent at timed intervals of five seconds. 

Sample `IMU` data:

```JSON
IMU {
    "eventName": "IMU",
    "message": {
        "created": "2019-01-09T21:47:53.7607457Z",
        "expiry": "2019-01-09T21:47:54.1607457Z",
        "pitch":0.193,
        "pitchAcceleration": 0.057,
        "roll": 0.9,
        "rollAcceleration": -0.1,
        "sensorId": "imu",
        "sensorName": null,
        "xAcceleration": 0.75,
        "yAcceleration": 0.73,
        "yaw": 2.004,
        "yawAcceleration": 0.096,
        "zAcceleration": 20.04
    },
    "type":"IMU"
}
```

## StringMessage
**Available for Misty II only**

The `StringMessage` data stream provides information sent to Misty by external hardware connected to the ports on her back. `StringMessage` events trigger when Misty receives data sent through one of these ports.

To send `StringMessage` data to Misty from an Arduino, use:

```C++
// ARDUINO

Serial.println("<your_data_to_Misty>")
```

Sending data to Misty as a JSON string can make it easier to parse the data in your skill code. This example shows how you can format data from a temperature and pressure sensor connected to an Arduino:

```C++
// ARDUINO

Serial.println("{\"temperature\":\""+String(<temp_value>)+"\",\"pressure\":\""+String(<pressure_value>)+"\"}");
```

Handle this data in a local skill by registering for `StringMessage` events. Add `StringMessage` as an additional return property, and parse the data in the `_StringMessage()` callback that triggers when the data is ready.

```JavaScript
// MISTY 

// Register for StringMessage events and add StringMessage as a return property
misty.AddReturnProperty("StringMessage", "StringMessage");
misty.RegisterEvent("StringMessage", "StringMessage", 0, true);

function _StringMessage(data) {
    if(data !== undefined && data !== null) {
        // Parse StringMessage data and assign it to a variable
        var obj = JSON.parse(data.AdditionalResults[0].Message);
        var temp = obj.temperature;
        var pressure = obj.pressure;
    }
}
```

For more about events and callbacks, see the [Data Handling: Events & Callbacks](../../../using-local-skills/architecture/#data-handling-events-amp-callbacks) section of [Using Local Skills](../../../coding/using-local-skills/architecture/).

## TouchSensor
**Available for Misty II only**

The `TouchSensor` data stream sends information each time one of the capacitive touch sensors on Misty's head is touched or released. In the `TouchSensor` data object, the value of the `sensorName` property is one of the following strings, indicating which sensor triggered the event: 
* `CapTouch_Chin` 
* `CapTouch_ChinLeft` 
* `CapTouch_ChinRight` 
* `CapTouch_HeadLeft` 
* `CapTouch_HeadRight` 
* `CapTouch_HeadBack`
* `CapTouch_HeadFront`
* `CapTouch_HeadTop`
* `CapTouch_Scruff`

The value of the `sensorPosition` property is a string indicating the location of the sensor. This value corresponds with the name of the sensor that triggered the event (i.e. when the `CapTouch_Chin` sensor triggers the event, the value of `sensorPosition` is `Chin`). The value of `isContacted` is a boolean indicating whether the sensor was touched (`true`) or released (`false`). The `TouchSensor` data object also provides “pose” information about Misty at the time of the event. For more about pose, see the [mapping section of the API Explorer documentation](../../../onboarding/apps/api-explorer/#mapping-amp-tracking-alpha).
