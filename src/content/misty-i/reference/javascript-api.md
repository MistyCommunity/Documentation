# {{title}}

Use Misty's on-robot JavaScript API to write skills that run locally on your robot. To learn about the architecture of this API, see [On-Robot JavaScript API Architecture](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture).

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Not all of Misty's API is equally complete. You may see some commands labeled "Beta" or "Alpha" because the related hardware, firmware, or software is still under development. Feel free to use these commands, but realize they may behave unpredictably at this time.

## Asset

Misty comes with a set of default images that you can display onscreen and sounds that you can play through her speakers. We encourage you to get creative and use your own image and audio assets in your skills.

### misty.DeleteAudio

Enables you to remove an audio file from Misty that you have previously saved. **Note:** You can only delete audio files that you have saved to Misty. You cannot remove Misty's default system audio files.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.DeleteAudio(string fileName, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

Arguments

* fileName (string) - The name of the file to delete, including its file type extension.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.DeleteAudio("DeleteMe.wav");
```

### misty.DeleteImage

Enables you to remove an image file from Misty that you have previously saved to her storage.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.DeleteImage(string fileName, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);

misty.SaveAudio(string fileName, string dataAsByteArrayString, [bool immediatelyApply], [bool overwriteExisting], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs])
```

Arguments

* fileName (string) - The name of the audio file. This command accepts all audio format types, however Misty currently cannot play OGG files.
* dataAsByteArrayString (string) - The audio data, passed as a string containing a byte array.
* immediatelyApply (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` tells Misty to immediately play the audio file, while a value of `false` tells Misty not to play the file.

```

### misty.SaveImage

Saves an image to Misty in the form of a byte array string. Optionally, proportionately reduces the size of the saved image.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.SaveImage(string fileName, string dataAsByteArrayString, [int width], [int height], [bool immediatelyApply], [bool overwriteExisting], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]
```

Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, and .png. Maximum file size is 3 MB. **Note:** Images can be reduced in size but not enlarged. Because Misty does not adjust the proportions of images, for best results use an image with proportions similar to her screen (480 x 272 pixels).

Arguments

* fileName (string) - The name of the image file to save.
* dataAsByteArrayString (string) - The image data, passed as a string containing a byte array.
* width (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image width (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `width` and `height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `width` and `height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* height (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image height (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `width` and `height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `width` and `height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* immediatelyApply (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` tells Misty to immediately display the saved image file, while a value of `false` tells Misty not to display the image.
* overwriteExisting (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` indicates the saved file should overwrite a file with the same name, if one currently exists on Misty. A value of `false` indicates the saved file should not overwrite any existing files on Misty.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.SaveImage("Filename.jpg", "137,80,78,71,13,1...", 500, 1000, false, false);
```

## Event

### misty.AddPropertyTest - ALPHA

Creates a property comparison test to specify which data the system sends for a registered event. Use property tests to filter unwanted data out of event messages.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.AddPropertyTest(string eventName, string property, string inequality, string valueAsString, string valueType, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

Arguments

* eventName (string) - The name of the event to create a property comparison test for.
* property (string) - The property of the event to compare. For the full list of properties for each event, see [Sensor & Skill Data Types](../../../misty-i/reference/sensor-data/).
* inequality (string) - The comparison operator to use in the property comparison test, passed as a string. Accepts `"=>"`, `"=="`, `"!=="`, `">"`, `"<"`, `">="`, `"<="`, `"exists"`, `"empty"`, or `"delta"`.
* valueAsString (string) - The value of the property to compare against, passed as a string. For the full list of values for each event property, see [Sensor & Skill Data Types](../../../misty-i/reference/sensor-data).
* valueType (string) - The type of the value specified in `"valueAsString"`. Accepts `"double"`, `"float"`, `"integer"`, "`string"`, `"datetime"`, or "`boolean`"
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.AddPropertyTest("EventName", "SensorPosition", "==", "Back", "string");
```

### misty.AddReturnProperty - ALPHA

Adds an additional return property field for a registered event.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.AddReturnProperty(string eventName, string eventProperty, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

Use the `misty.AddReturnProperty()` method to add the values of specific properties from an event message to the data object passed to the callback function for the event. When the event callback handles the data object for an event, the data object includes the values of any properties added with `misty.AddReturnProperty()` in an array called `AdditionalResults`.

You can add multiple return properties to the same event. The order of values in the `AdditionalResults` array matches the order in which you added those properties to the event in your skill code. For an example of how this works, see how the following code adds return properties to a `BumpSensor` event:

```javascript
// Add the value of the sensorName and isContacted properties of
// BumpSensor event to the data you want to receive with "Bumped"
// event messages
misty.AddReturnProperty("Bumped", "sensorName");
misty.AddReturnProperty("Bumped", "isContacted");
// Register for BumpSensor events
misty.RegisterEvent("Bumped", "BumpSensor", 50 ,true);

function _Bumped(data) {
     // The value of sensorName is at index 0
     var sensor = data.AdditionalResults[0]
     // The value of isContacted is at index 1
     var isContacted = data.AdditionalResults[1]
     misty.Debug("Sensor: " + sensor + ", is contacted: " + isContacted)
}
```

Arguments

* eventName (string) - The name of the event to add a return property field for.
* eventProperty (string) - The additional property to return.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.AddReturnProperty("EventName", "DistanceInMeters");
```


### misty.RegisterEvent - ALPHA

Register to receive messages with live event data from one of Misty's sensors. 

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.RegisterEvent(string eventName, string messageType, int debounce, [bool keepAlive = false], [string callbackRule = "synchronous"], [string skillToCall], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for this command are given the same name as the correlated event, prefixed with an underscore: `_<eventName>`. For more on handling event data, see [Sensor Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#sensor-event-callbacks).
{{box op="end"}}

* messageType (string) - The name of the data stream to register for events from. Matches the predefined `Type` property value for the data stream as listed [here](../../../misty-i/reference/sensor-data).
* debounce (integer) - Sets the frequency in milliseconds with which event data is sent. 
* keepAlive (boolean) - Optional. Pass `true` to keep the callback function registered to the event after the callback function is triggered. By default, when an event callback is triggered, the event unregisters the callback to prevent more commands from overriding the initial call. 
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`.
* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.

Returns

* Data sent by the registered event. Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. For more information, see [Sensor Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#sensor-event-callbacks).


### misty.RegisterTimerEvent - ALPHA

Creates an event that calls a callback function after a specified period of time. For an example of using this function, see the [Timer Event tutorial](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-tutorials/#timer-events).

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.RegisterTimerEvent(string eventName, int callbackTimeInMs, [bool keepAlive], [string callbackRule], [string skillToCall], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for this command are given the same name as the correlated event, prefixed with an underscore: `_<eventName>`. For more on handling event data, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* eventName (string) - The name for the timer event. Note that the name you give to this timer event determines the name automatically assigned to your related callback function. That is, the system sets the name of the callback function to be the same as this event name, prefixed with an underscore (`_<eventName>`). For example, for an event name of `MyTimerEvent`, your callback function must use the name `_MyTimerEvent`. 
* callbackTimeInMs (integer) - The amount of time in milliseconds to wait before the system calls the callback function. For example, passing a value of 3000 causes the system to wait 3 seconds.
* keepAlive (boolean) -  Optional. By default (`false`) this timer event calls your callback only once. If you pass `true`, your callback function is called in a loop, with a frequency determined by `callbackTimeInMs`. To end the loop, call the `misty.UnregisterEvent()` function in your code.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`.
* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.RegisterTimerEvent("EventName", 5000, false);
```

Returns

* Data sent by the timed event. Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. For more information, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).

### misty.RegisterUserEvent - ALPHA

Creates an event that calls a callback function at a point of your choosing. You trigger the event by making a REST call to the `<robot-ip-address>/api/skills/event` endpoint with the appropriate payload for the callback and/or skill.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.RegisterUserEvent(string eventName, [bool keepAlive], [string callbackRule], [string skillToCall], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs])
```

Once you register the event with `misty.RegisterUserEvent()`, to trigger the event you must make a REST call to the event endpoint with a POST command:

```http
POST <robot-ip-address>/api/skills/event
```

With a JSON body similar to:

```json
{
    "UniqueId" : "b307c917-beb8-47e8-9bbf-1c57e8cd4d4b",
    "EventName": "UserEventName",
    "Payload": { "mydata": "two" }
}
```

The `UniqueId` and `EventName` values are required and must match the ID of the skill to call and the event name you used in that skill. You should place any payload data you wish to send to the skill in the `Payload` field.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for this command are given the same name as the correlated event, prefixed with an underscore: `_<eventName>`. For more on handling event data, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* eventName (string) - The name for the event. Note that the name you give to this event determines the name automatically assigned to your related callback function. That is, the system sets the name of the callback function to be the same as this event name, prefixed with an underscore (`_<eventName>`). For example, for an event name of `MyUserEvent`, your callback function must use the name `_MyUserEvent`. 
* keepAlive (bool) - Optional. By default (`false`) the event is triggered only once. If you pass `true`, you can trigger the event repeatedly. To remove this event, call the `misty.UnregisterEvent()` function in your code.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. By default (`Synchronous`) the system runs the triggered callback concurrently with any other running threads. Other values are `Override` and `Abort`. `Override` tells the system to run the new callback thread but to stop running commands on any other threads, including the thread the callback was called within. The system only runs the thread the callback was triggered in, once the callback comes back. `Abort` tells the system to ignore the new callback thread if the skill is still doing work on any other threads (including the original thread the callback was called within). 
* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique ID of a skill to call when the event is triggered. Use this value if the callback function is not defined in the same skill as the user event is registered in.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.RegisterUserEvent("EventName", false);
```

Returns

* Data sent by the user event. Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. For more information, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).

## External Requests

### misty.SendExternalRequest - ALPHA

Sends an HTTP request from Misty to an external server. You use `misty.SendExternalRequest()` to access resources that are available via Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as cloud-based APIs or data stored on a server in another location.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.SendExternalRequest(string method, string resource, [string authorizationType], [string token], [string arguments], [bool save], [bool applyAssetAfterSaving], [string fileName], [string contentType], [string callback], [string callbackRule], [string skillToCall], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** In most cases, the external server's response to requests sent from the robot must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skills. By default, the callback function for this command is given the same name as the command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by `misty.SendExternalRequest()`, see the [External Requests](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-tutorials/#external-requests) tutorial.
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* method (string) - The [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/HTTP/Methods) (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc.) indicating the action to perform for the resource.
* resourceURL (string) - The full Uniform Resource Identifier of the resource, i.e. `"http://soundbible.com/grab.php?id=1949&type=mp3"`.
* authorizationType (string) - The authentication type required to access the resource, i.e. `"OAuth 1.0"`, `"OAuth 2.0"`, or `"Bearer Token"`. Use `null` if no authentication is required.
* token (string) - The authentication credentials required to access the resource. Use `null` if no credentials are required.
* arguments (string) - The arguments to send with the request, passed as a string written in JSON format with key-value pairs for each parameter option. If the request does not require additional arguments, pass `null` or an empty JSON string (`"{}"`).

* save (bool) - If `true`, the robot saves any media asset contained in the request response to the robot's local storage. If you do not want to save any returned assets, pass `false`. At this time, the `misty.SendExternalRequest()` command can save only image and audio files to Misty. 
* apply (bool) - A value of `true` or `false` indicating whether to immediately use a media asset once it has been saved to Misty's local storage. Use `true` to immediately play an audio asset or display an image asset on Misty's screen. Note that to successfully apply a media asset, you must also pass `true` for the `saveAssetToRobot` parameter.
* fileName (string) - The name to give the saved file, including the appropriate file type extension.
* callback (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the returned data is received. If empty, a callback function with the default name (`_SendExternalRequest()`) is called.

Returns

* Data (object) - An object containing the external server's response to the request. In most cases, data returned by the `misty.SendExternalRequest()` command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skills. See the [External Requests](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-tutorials/#external-requests) tutorial for more information.

## Movement

Drives Misty forward or backward at a specific speed until cancelled. Call `misty.Stop()` to cancel driving. 

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.Drive(double linearVelocity, double angularVelocity, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

When using the `misty.Drive()` command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Arguments

* linearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
* angularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note:** For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.DriveTime(double linearVelocity, double angularVelocity, int timeMs, [double degree], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

When using the `misty.DriveTime()` command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Arguments

* linearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
* angularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note:** For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.
* timeMs (integer) - A value in milliseconds that specifies the duration of movement. Misty will not drive if you pass in a value of less than 100 for this argument.
* degree (double) - (optional) The number of degrees to turn. **Note:** Supplying a `degree` value recalculates linear velocity.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

## Navigation

"SLAM" refers to simultaneous localization and mapping. This is a robot's ability to both create a map of the world and know where they are in it at the same time. Misty's SLAM capabilities and hardware are under development. For a step-by-step mapping exercise, see the instructions with the [Command Center](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/command-center/#navigation-alpha).

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** If you are mapping with a **Misty I**, please be aware of the following:

* The USB cable connecting the headboard to the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor is known to fail in some Misty prototypes. This can cause intermittent or non-working mapping and localization functionality.
* Misty prototypes can only create and store one map at a time, and a map must be created in a single mapping session.
* Mapping a large room with many obstacles can consume all of the memory resources on the processor used for mapping and crash the device.
* Some Misty I and some Misty II prototypes may generate inaccurate maps due to depth sensor calibration flaws.
{{box op="end"}}

### misty.StartSlamStreaming

Opens the data stream from the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor, so you can obtain image and depth data when Misty is not actively tracking or mapping.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.StartSlamStreaming([int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Important!** Always use `misty.StopSlamStreaming()` to close the depth sensor data stream after sending commands that use Misty's Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Calling `misty.StopSlamStreaming()` turns off the laser in the depth sensor and lowers Misty's power consumption. Note that Misty's 4K camera may not work while the depth sensor data stream is open.
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.StartSlamStreaming();

Closes the data stream from the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Calling this command turns off the laser in the depth sensor and lowers Misty's power consumption.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.StopSlamStreaming([int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Always use this command to close the depth sensor data stream after using `misty.StartSlamStreaming()` and any commands that use Misty's Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Note that Misty's 4K camera may not work while the depth sensor data stream is open.
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.

  * image (array) - A matrix of size `height` x `width` containing individual values of type float. Each value is the distance in millimeters from the sensor for each pixel in the captured image. For example, if you point the sensor at a flat wall 2 meters away, most of the values in the matrix should be around 2000. Note that as the robot moves further away from a scene being viewed, each pixel value will represent a larger surface area. Conversely, if it moves closer, each pixel value will represent a smaller area.
  * width (integer) - The width of the matrix.

### misty.TakeFisheyePicture

### misty.GetMap - ALPHA

Obtains occupancy grid data for the most recent map Misty has generated. 

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.GetMap([string callback], [string callbackRule = "synchronous"], [string skillToCall], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** With the on-robot JavaScript API, data returned by this and other "Get" type commands must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for "Get" type commands are given the same name as the correlated command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by "Get" type commands, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#-quot-get-quot-data-callbacks).
{{box op="end"}}

To obtain a valid response from `misty.GetMap()`, Misty must first have successfully generated a map. 

Misty’s maps are squares that are constructed around her initial physical location when she starts mapping. When a map is complete, it is a square with Misty’s starting point at the center.

The occupancy grid for the map is represented by a two-dimensional matrix. Each element in the occupancy grid represents an individual cell of space. The value of each element (0, 1, 2, or 3) indicates the nature of the space in those cells (respectively: "unknown", "open", "occupied", or "covered").

Each cell corresponds to a pair of X,Y coordinates that you can use with the `misty.FollowPath()`, `misty.DriveToLocation()`, and `misty.GetSlamPath()` commands. The first cell in the first array of the occupancy grid is the origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. 

Arguments

* callback (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the data returned by this command is ready. If empty, the default callback function (`<_CommandName>`) is called.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`. For a description of callback rules, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#-quot-get-quot-data-callbacks).
* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
// Example
misty.GetMap();
```

Returns

* Result (object) - An object containing the following key-value pairs. With Misty's on-robot JavaScript API, data returned by this command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. See ["Get" Data Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#-quot-get-quot-data-callbacks) for more information.
  * grid (array of arrays) - The occupancy grid for the most recent map Misty has generated, represented by a matrix of cells. The number of arrays is equal to the value of the `height` parameter. The number of cells is equal to the product of `height` x `width`. Each individual value (0, 1, 2, or 3) in the matrix represents a single cell of space. 0 indicates "unknown" space, 1 indicates "open" space, 2 indicates "occupied" space, and 3 indicates "covered" space. Each cell corresponds to an X,Y coordinate on the occupancy grid. The first cell in the first array is the X,Y origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. If no map is available, grid returns `null`.
  * height (integer) - The height of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells).
  * isValid (boolean) - Returns a value of `true` if the data returned represents a valid map. If no valid map data is available, returns a value of `false`.
  * metersPerCell (integer) - A value in square meters stating the size of each cell in the occupancy grid matrix.
  * originX (float) - The distance in meters from the X value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the X coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to an X coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originX` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * originY (float) - The distance in meters from the Y value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the Y coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to a Y coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originY` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * size (integer) - The total number of map cells represented in the grid array. Multiply this number by the value of meters per cell to calculate the area of the map in square meters.
  * width (integer) - The width of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells).

## Perception

The following commands allow you to programmatically take pictures, record sounds or videos, and have misty detect and learn to recognize faces. 

Like most of us, Misty sees faces best in a well-lit area. If you want to directly experiment with face recognition commands, you can use the [Command Center](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/command-center/#perception).

To programmatically obtain live data streams back from Misty that include face detection and recognition data, you can [subscribe](../../coding-misty/remote-command-architecture/#getting-data-from-misty) to her FaceRecognition [WebSocket](../../reference/sensor-data). To directly observe this data, you can use the [Command Center](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/command-center/#opening-a-websocket).

```

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** With local skills, data returned by this and other "Get" type commands must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for "Get" type commands are given the same name as the correlated command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by "Get" type commands, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#-quot-get-quot-data-callbacks).
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

* callback (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the data returned by this command is ready. If empty, the default callback function (`_GetRunningSkills()`) is called.

* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.

```javascript
//Example
misty.GetRunningSkills();
```

Returns

* result (array) - A list of objects with meta information about the skills currently running on Misty. If no skills are currently running, this command returns an empty array. Note that in a local skill, data returned by this command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill (see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/local-skill-architecture/#-quot-get-quot-data-callbacks) for more information). Each object in the list includes the following key-value pairs:

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.Debug(string data, [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

You can think of `misty.Debug()` as the Misty version of `console.log()`. When you use Skill Runner to run a skill, the web page subscribes to the `SkillData` named object via Misty's WebSocket connection. This allows Misty to print error messages, debug messages, and other skill data to the console in your web browser. Use `misty.Debug()` to print your own messages to the console.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Data you pass into the `misty.Debug()` message must be a string. To send a data object, you can serialize your data into a string and parse it out on the client side of the `SkillData` subscription. If `BroadcastMode` is set to `off` in the meta file for a skill, the skill does not publish debug data.
{{box op="end"}}

Arguments

// Example
misty.Keys();
```

Returns

* keys (list) - A list of the keys and values for all available persistent data stored on the robot.

### misty.Pause - ALPHA

Pause skill execution for a specified number of milliseconds.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.Pause(int prePauseMs)
```

Arguments

* prePauseMs (integer) - The duration in milliseconds to pause skill execution.

```javascript
// Example
misty.Pause(1000);
```

### misty.Publish - ALPHA

Writes data to the robot's internal log.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.Publish(string name, string data)
```

Note that `misty.Publish()` writes data to the robot's internal log file, even when called in a skill with the value of `WriteToLog` set to `False` in its meta file. You can use the Command Center to download your robot's log files, or send a GET request to the REST endpoint for the [`GetLogFile`](../../../misty-i/reference/rest/#getlogfile) command.

Arguments

* name (string) - A name for the data to write to the robot's log.
* data (string, integer, double, or boolean) - The data to write to the robot's log. To write an object, you must serialize your data into a string using `JSON.stringify()`.ƒ

```javascript
// Example
misty.Publish("data-name", "data-value");
```

### misty.RandomPause - ALPHA

Pause skill execution for a random duration.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.RandomPause(int minimumDelay, int maximumDelay)
```

Arguments

* minimumDelay (integer) - The minimum duration in milliseconds to pause skill execution.
* maximumDelay (integer) - The maximum duration in milliseconds to pause skill execution. 

```javascript
// Example

### misty.Set - ALPHA

Saves data that can be validly updated and used across threads or shared between skills.

```javascript
// Syntax
misty.Set(string key, string value, [bool longTermStorage], [int prePauseMs], [int postPauseMs]);
```

Data saved using `misty.Set()` must be one of these types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, or `double`. Alternately, you can serialize your data into a string using `JSON.stringify()` and parse it out again using `JSON.parse()`.

By default, long term data saved by the `misty.Set()` command clears from Misty's memory when Misty reboots. To change this, you need to include an additional `SkillStorageLifetime` key in the meta file for your skill. The `SkillStorageLifetime` key determines how long data saved to Misty with the `misty.Set()` command remains available for use in your skills. You can set the value of `SkillStorageLifetime` to `Skill`, `Reboot`, or `LongTerm`.

* `Skill` - The data clears when the skill stops running.
* `Reboot` - The data clears the next time Misty reboots.
* `LongTerm` - The data persists across reboots and remains available until removed from the robot with the mi`sty.Remove()` command.

You can safely omit the `SkillStorageLifetime` key from the meta file if you do not want to modify the default behavior of persistent data for that skill.

Arguments

* key (string) - The key name for the data to save.
* value (value) - The data to save. Data saved using `misty.Set()` must be one of these types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, or `double`.
* longTermStorage (boolean) - Whether to save the data to long term storage. Defaults to `false`.
* prePauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPauseMs (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next comm
and in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPauseMs` is not used.
