Welcome! Your [Misty I](../misty-i) robot has been hand-built by the Misty Robotics team. When your robot arrives, please read these docs for some quick, out-of-box assembly steps and other helpful details.

Once you get your robot powered up, you can quickly control Misty via her [companion app](../../../tools-&-apps/mobile/misty-app), [API Explorer](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/api-explorer), or the [Command Center](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/command-center). The real fun starts when you write your first skill for Misty; go [here](../../../misty-i/coding-misty/introduction) to get started coding Misty.

## Getting Support

If you get stuck or have questions while developing for and interacting with your Misty I robot, there are several ways to get help.

* For **questions about coding Misty**, post in the Community Forums first. This gives other developers – in addition to all of the Misty staff – the ability to jump in and help. The [Support](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/support), [Feature Requests](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/feature-requests), and [Bug](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/bugs) categories (in particular) are monitored for immediate response from 9am-6pm Mountain Time on weekdays and from 9am-4pm Mountain Time on weekends.
* For **product support** – for example, for shipping questions, or issues with Misty's general functionality – email us at support@mistyrobotics.com. Our email support hours are 9 AM to 5 PM MST Monday through Friday.

## Additional Resources

You can find helper libraries, code samples, wrappers, and other useful tools for skill development in the [Misty Robotics Community](https://github.com/MistyCommunity) on GitHub.
