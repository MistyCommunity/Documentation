Welcome to the Misty II Getting Started guide! This document provides a set of activities to familiarize developers with Misty II, her SDK, and her web-based developer tools.

Follow this guide to learn:

* how to use Misty's [Command Center](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/command-center) to discover your robot's capabilities and send basic commands before writing your own code
* how to use Misty's [API Explorer](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/api-explorer) to interact with Misty's REST API and generate sample code for your skills and robot applications
* how to install and run your own skills on Misty II via Misty's [Skill Runner](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner/index.html)
* how to set up the Misty Skills Extension for Visual Studio Code to deploy skills without leaving your text editor

**Before you begin**, you need:
* a Misty II robot that's powered on and connected to your local Wi-Fi network.
* the IP address for your Misty II robot, which you can find in the Misty App for mobile devices.

**Before getting started**, place Misty on the black foam block from her box. This will ensure that, as you program her, she doesn’t accidentally roll off the table.

## Sending Basic Commands

The [Command Center](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/command-center/index.html) is a graphic interface for sending commands to Misty without writing any code. Follow the steps in this section of the Getting Started guide to familiarize yourself with the different elements of the Command Center.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** We recommend using the Command Center with the latest version of the Google Chrome browser.
{{box op="end"}}

Follow these steps to start using the Command Center:

1. [Open up the Command Center](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/command-center) in a browser window.
2. Enter your robot's IP address in the upper-right hand corner of the page and click the **Connect** button. (You can find your robot's IP address in the Misty App.) Look for a "Connected successfully" message to appear at the bottom of the browser window.

Once you're connected, you can experiment with Misty's functionality by interacting with different elements of the Command Center. Here are a few things to try:

* Use the **Quick Commands** section to change the color of Misty's chest LED, show a different image on her display, and have her play a sound. ![Quick Commands](../../../assets/images/command_center_quick_commands.png)
  * Use the color picker or type in different RGB values and click the **Change LED** button. For example, if you wanted Misty's LED to be purple, use **Red**: `101`; **Green**: `73`; and **Blue**: `157`.
  * Change Misty's eyes by choosing a different file from the **Change Display Image** menu. For example, try changing her eyes to `Sad.png` or `Angry.png`.
  * Play a sound by choosing a file from the **Play Audio File** menu.
* Use the **Movement** section to move Misty's head and arms. ![Head and arm movement controls](../../../assets/images/command_center_head_movement.png)
  * Move Misty's head by moving the sliders under **Head Movement**. Set a new **Pitch**, **Yaw**, or **Roll** position, and then click the **Set** button.
  * Move Misty's arms by moving the left or right slider and clicking the **Rotate Left Arm** or **Rotate Right Arm** button.
* To prepare Misty for the Hello World tutorial series, use the **Perception** section to train Misty to recognize your face. ![Face Training interface](../../../assets/images/command_center_face_training_interface.png)
  1. To make sure Misty's head is positioned for effective face training, use the **Pitch**, **Yaw** and **Roll** commands under the **Movement** section to align Misty’s gaze with yours. Then, in the **Perception** section, go to **Face Training** and type your name in the **Name to Train** field. Make sure to enter a single word without spaces.
  2. Click the **Start Face Training** button. Wait 10-15 seconds for face training to complete. The main Command Center window displays pop-up status messages during the face training process.
  3. When face training is complete, you can click the **Get Learned Faces** button to see the labels for people Misty can recognize. Check for your name to make sure Misty learned your face!
* Use Misty's camera to take a picture. ![Take Picture controls](../../../assets/images/command_center_take_photo.png)
  * Use the head movement controls to point Misty's visor at something you'd like to photograph. In the **4K Camera** section, click the **Take + Display Photo** button to see what Misty’s sees.

## Exploring Misty's API

You can use Misty's [API Explorer](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/api-explorer) to browse Misty's list of REST API endpoints, send requests to Misty, experiment with different parameters, and generate code samples for Misty's REST API and on-robot JavaScript API. This section of the Getting Started guide teaches how to start using the API Explorer to send commands directly to your robot.

Follow these steps to start learning about the API Explorer:

1. Follow the link at the top of the Command Center to open up the [API Explorer](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/api-explorer) web page. If Misty is still connected to the Command Center when you do this, this connection carries over to the API Explorer, and there's no need to reconnect. If not, you'll need to use Misty's IP address to connect your robot to the API Explorer.
2. Start by changing the color of Misty's chest LED. Open the **Expression** group in the left-hand side of the page and select the **ChangeLED** command. ![ChangeLED in API Explorer](../../../assets/images/api_explorer_changeLED.png)
3. Under the **Parameters** section, add a value between `0` and `255` in the **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** fields. For example, if you want her LED to be fuschia, use **Red**: `204`, **Green**: `0`, **Blue**: `204`. ![API Explorer ChangeLED parameters](../../../assets/images/api_explorer_changeLED_params.png)
4. Click **Send Request** to send the command and change the LED.
5. Next let’s play an audio clip on Misty. Select the **Expression** group from the list on the left-hand side of the page, and click on the **PlayAudioClip** command. 
6. Enter the file name for one of Misty's default system audio files into the **FileName** field. Try using `034-Hicup.wav`,
`013-0Bark.wav`, or `001-Veep.wav`. Set the volume to a number between `10` and `100`, and then click **Send Request**. ![API Explorer play audio clip parameters](../../../assets/images/api_explorer_playAudio_params.png)
1. Lastly, let’s change Misty's eyes. Select the **ChangeDisplayImage** command from the list of commands. Enter `Relaxed.png`, `Afraid.png`, or `Waking.jpg` into the **FileName** field, and click **Send Request**.

## Uploading Skills with Skill Runner

The [Skill Runner](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner/index.html) web page allows you to install, run, and manage skills on Misty. This section of the Misty II Getting Started guide teaches how to use the Skill Runner to deploy the sample `MultiplePersonality` skill to Misty. When you run this skill, Misty displays a different personality when you press one of her bump sensors.

You can download the files for the `Misty-Multiple-Personality` skill from the [`Misty-Multiple-Personality` repository in the MistySampleSkills GitHub organization](https://github.com/MistySampleSkills/Misty-Multiple-Personality). This repository includes:
* `MultiplePersonality.js`, which contains the JavaScript that Misty executes when she runs the skill
* `MultiplePersonality.json`, which contains a JSON object with metadata and and parameters required to run a skill

Create a new folder on your desktop called **MultiplePersonality**. Download the `Misty-Multiple-Personality` skill files to that folder. Then, follow these steps to install and run the skill on your Misty II:

1. Follow the link at the top of the API Explorer to open up the [Skill Runner](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner) web page. If Misty is still connected to the API Explorer when you do this, this connection carries over to the Skill Runner, and there's no need to reconnect. If not, you'll need to use Misty's IP address to connect your robot to the Skill Runner.
2. Open your browser's web console to view debug messages, error messages, and other data Misty sends to the Skill Runner web page. To open the web console in Chrome, use **Ctrl + Shift + J** (Windows) **Ctrl + Shift + X** (Linux) **Cmd + Option + J** (Mac).
3. Under the **Install** section of the Skill Runner, click **Choose a file**. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the `lookAround.json` and `lookAround.json` files. Select **both files** and then click **Open**.
4. When the skill uploads, it appears in the **Manage** section of the Skill Runner page. Find the **lookAround** skill and click **Start** to run it, or stop to **stop the skill.**

## Setting Up the Misty Skills Extension for Visual Studio Code

In addition to deploying skills from the the Skill Runner web page, you can also deploy skills to Misty directly from the Visual Studio Code editor. You can [download Visual Studio Code for free from Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow [these instructions](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/tools-&-apps/plugins-&-extensions/misty-skills-extension/) to install the Misty Skills Extension for VSC.

Now that you are set-up with VSC and understand how Misty’s Extension works, let’s start programming a skill!

### Editing Code and Deploying Skills to Misty

This section of the getting started guide describes how to use the VSC extension to edit the `MultiplePersonality` skill and deploy your updated skill to Misty. Follow these instructions to get started:

1.  The Misty Skills Extension for VSC works with **folders**. The **folder and the two skill files must have the same**. The first step is to **create a new folder** on your desktop and name it whatever you like.
2.  Open the `MultiplePersonality.js` file in Visual Studio Code then click **Save As**. **Save the .js file with the same name you gave the new folder, and then click Save**. This will be the name of the modified skill.
3.  Switch **back to your browser and navigate to [Misty’s web-based tools](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/)**. Click on **Skill Runner** in the menu bar.
4.  In the **Generate** section, enter the name you used for the folder and .js file in the **New Skill Name** field. 
5.  Select the **Download** option, and then click **Generate JSON Meta Template**. 
6.  **Move the downloaded JSON file** to the new skill folder where you saved the .js code file. 
7.  Switch back to **VSC** and open the contents of your new folder.
8.  **Click to open the .js code file**. Try replacing the audio and/or image files used in the skill code with the following filenames, and save the file with your changes:
    **Eye Files:				Audio Files:**
    Relaxed.png				034-Hicup.wav
    Afraid.png				013-0Bark.wav
    Waking.jpg				001-Veep.wav
9.  Now it’s time to deploy your code to the robot by using the **Misty Extension in VSC**. 
10. There are two ways run the commands to deploy code. The first is to **click View in the menu bar, then Command Palette…**. You can also use one of the shortcuts listed below:
  * For PC users: Press Control+Shift+P and select: **Misty: Upload and Run** 
  * For Mac users: Press Command+Shift+P and select: **Misty: Upload and Run**
11. **Enter the IP address** for Misty. Check the status on the bottom right hand corner to confirm your skill is running. Press Misty's bump sensors to see her reactions.
12.  To **stop your skill**, use the Misty Extension in VSC by following the process outlined in step 10. Either click View and then **Command Palette**, or use one of the shortcuts below:
  * For **PC users**: Press Control+Shift+P and select: **Misty: Stop Skill**
  * For **Mac users**: Press Command+Shift+P and select: **Misty: Stop Skills** 

## What's Next?

Now that you've spent some time with Misty and her tools, you're ready to write your first robot skill. We suggest working through Misty's [Hello World Tutorial Series](../../../misty-ii/robot/hello-world) next!

## Getting Support

If you get stuck or have questions while developing for and interacting with your Misty II robot, there are several ways to get help.

* For **questions about coding Misty**, post in the Community Forums first. This gives other developers – in addition to all of the Misty staff – the ability to jump in and help. The [Support](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/support), [Feature Requests](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/feature-requests), and [Bug](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/bugs) categories (in particular) are monitored for immediate response from 9am-6pm Mountain Time on weekdays and from 9am-4pm Mountain Time on weekends.
* For **product support** – for example, for shipping questions, or issues with Misty's general functionality – email us at support@mistyrobotics.com. Our email support hours are 9 AM to 5 PM MST Monday through Friday.

Also – and this is **just for field trial testers** (AKA members with a **Launch Crew** badge on the Misty Community forums) – you should have received an invitation to join the [Misty Community Slack](http://misty-community.slack.com/). Use Slack to request real-time support and have conversations with other Misty users and employees. Slack support hours are 9 AM to 6 PM MST Monday through Friday, and 9 AM to 4 PM MST Saturday and Sunday.
