This article provides an overview of developing skills for Misty. It describes how Misty works with your code, and it explores some of the differences between developing for Misty and developing for other platforms. It also provides guidelines for sharing skills and collaborating with other developers in the [Misty Community](https://community.mistyrobotics.com).

## What is a Skill?

A skill is an application you develop for the Misty platform. While you can build many different types of skills, most involve some combination of the following:

1. gathering some of Misty's sensory data
2. processing that data using Misty's API, or sending it off to a cloud service
3. having Misty do something in response

For example, you might write skills to have Misty do the following:

* roam an office to greet people she recognizes
* respond with sound and movement when you touch her on the head or chin
* patrol an area to capture photos, videos, and audio recordings while reporting changes in the environment

The first step in coding Misty is deciding what you want the robot to do. Then, you can choose to write your code using Misty's JavaScript SDK, her REST API, or both. When you're ready, you can share your code with other developers in the Misty Community.

## Using Misty's APIs

At a high level, there are two different ways to write code for Misty. When you write a skill using Misty's [JavaScript SDK](../../../misty-ii/javascript-sdk/javascript-skill-architecture), you upload your code to the robot and it runs internally on Misty. This differs from using Misty's [REST API](../../rest-api/overview), where your code runs on an external device (say, in desktop browser or on a Raspberry Pi) and not onboard the robot.

Misty's JavaScript and REST APIs include many of the same commands, but they differ in architecture and implementation.

### Misty's JavaScript SDK

When you use Misty's JavaScript SDK, your code runs locally on your robot. Each skill you write this way runs from a single JavaScript code file. You [upload this code file to Misty](../../../misty-ii/javascript-sdk/javascript-skill-architecture/#loading-amp-running-a-javascript-skill) along with a .json meta file that defines some of the initial settings and parameters that Misty will use when running the skill. If the skill uses image or audio assets that don't yet exist on the robot, you can upload these assets at the same time you upload your skill code. Learn more about this process in the [File Structure & Code Architecture](../../../misty-ii/javascript-sdk/javascript-skill-architecture/#file-structure-amp-code-architecture) section.

**Note:** If you're used to writing JavaScript for the web, you may be familiar with  manipulating the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/API/Document_Object_Model) in your code. With Misty, there is no DOM for your code to manipulate. Skills you write with Misty's JavaScript SDK cannot use the various [objects and data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#Important_Data_Types) present in the DOM.

The syntax for using a command in Misty's JavaScript API is:

```JS
misty.<COMMAND>(parameters);
```

So, for example, to change the color of Mistyâ€™s logo LED, you would call the
`misty.ChangeLED()` command like this:

```JS
misty.ChangeLED(255, 0, 0);
```

In addition to methods for using Misty's robot capabilities, the on-robot JavaScript API includes methods for:

* sending debug messages
* saving data to Misty
* handling data from sensor and skill events
* controlling the flow of your code's execution
* sending external requests to third party web APIs
* starting and stopping the execution of other JavaScript code files on Misty

* [Reference Documentation](../../../misty-ii/javascript-sdk/api-reference)

#### When Should I Use Misty's JavaScript SDK?

Code you write with Misty's JavaScript SDK executes locally on the robot. This means you can expect Misty to respond to commands immediately after they execute in your code. This differs from using Misty's REST API, where you can expect some latency between the execution of a command and Misty's response. 

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed tipBox"}}
**Tip:** Writing skills that can run entirely on Misty offers portability and allows you to easily package and redistribute skills for reuse. Being able to encapsulate and reuse skills is the key to having a robot that does many tasks.
{{box op="end"}}

Consider using Misty's JavaScript SDK when:

* you want your skill to be portable, so that Misty can run it without depending on or requiring an external device
* you want to be able to package and share your functionality with other developers or Misty owners
* you need Misty to respond to commands immediately after they execute in your code
* your skill does not require input from another interface (like text from a computer)

#### Uploading Skill Files to Misty

After you write the JavaScript code for a skill, you must upload your files onto the robot before you can run it. To learn how to load a skill onto Misty, see [Loading & Running On-Robot Skills](../../../misty-ii/javascript-sdk/javascript-skill-architecture/#loading-amp-running-a-javascript-skill).

### Misty's REST API

With Misty's REST API, your code runs on an external device and makes HTTP requests to Misty over your local Wi-Fi connection. You send requests to Misty's REST API the same way you interact with other RESTful web APIs. The code you write to send these requests can execute from a web page, a microcontroller (like an Arduino), or any other device that can send web requests.

Writing a robot application with Misty's REST API typically involves two things:

* getting data from Misty's sensors via WebSocket connections
* sending requests to Misty's REST API endpoints

The structure and syntax for sending requests to Misty's REST API endpoints depends on the programming language and libraries you use to write your skill. For an example of sending requests with JavaScript from your web browser, see [Sending Commands to Misty](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/misty-ii/rest-api/overview/#sending-commands-to-misty).

#### When Should I Use Misty's REST API?

Code you write for Misty's REST API runs on a device outside Misty to send requests over your local Wi-Fi network. This can introduce some latency between the moment your skill sends a request and Misty's execution of the associated command.

It also means you can integrate the capabilities of the device from which the code executes into your skill. For example, if you use Misty's REST API to write skill for Misty to learn someone's face, you can design a web interface with a form where this person can type their name and send it to Misty.

Consider using Misty's REST API when:

* you want to write a skill for Misty using a language other than JavaScript
* your skill depends on the integration of a graphic interface, like a web page
* your skill uses the capabilities of an external device that cannot communicate with Misty directly through her built-in UART serial port
* you want to use JavaScript features that are not supported by Misty's JavaScript engine
* your skill uses third-party services not yet supported by Misty's JavaScript SDK

* [Tutorials](../../../misty-ii/rest-api/tutorials)
* [Reference Documentation](../../../misty-ii/rest-api/api-reference)

### Integrating Misty's APIs

When you start building skills for Misty, you will likely discover how useful it can be to combine functionality from her JavaScript SDK with her REST API. 

The REST API includes endpoints for starting and stopping the skills that are already installed on the robot. Additionally, you can use the REST API to trigger events within skills that are already running, and to pass external data into the event callback functions to be processed in the on-robot skill. The inverse is also true; with the `misty.SendExternalRequest()` method, your on-robot skills can send web requests to other devices or third-party cloud services. Misty's ability to interact with other devices and applications makes it possible to invoke skills programmatically and coordinate new interactions between Misty, the cloud, and other computing devices.

### Community Resources

You can find helper libraries, code samples, wrappers, and other useful tools for skill development in the [Misty Robotics Community](https://github.com/MistyCommunity) on GitHub.

For examples of working skills that use a variety of Misty's capabilities, see [Misty Skill Samples](https://github.com/MistySampleSkills/) on GitHub.

## Sharing Skills

When you have a skill you want to share, we encourage you to post the skill to the [Misty Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/). Our recommendation for sharing skills is as follows:

* Remove any passwords, credentials, API keys, or tokens your skill uses from your code.
    1. If your skill uses 3rd party services, we recommend you create a `credentials.json` file where you can store the relevant details.
    2. To help your fellow developers, annotate your code in the places where the skill uses these accounts and credentials. You can list the details and instructions about how to acquire and use credentials in the skill in a `README` file in the same repository as the skill.
* Create a repository that you maintain on GitHub or somewhere else where other developers can download your code.
* License your repository. You can use whichever license you'd like. For more information about choosing a license, see GitHub's article on [Licensing a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository).
* Create a new topic for your skill in the [Misty Skills category of the Misty Community forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/misty-skills).
* Set the first post in your topic to be a wiki. This will allow you and other contributors to suggest changes to the original post as development on your skill continues.
   1. To set your post to be a wiki, select the three-dots icon from the menu below the post. ![Discourse Wik Step 1](../../../assets/images/discourse-wiki-step-1.png)
   2. Select the wrench icon. ![Discourse Wik Step 2](../../../assets/images/discourse-wiki-step-2.png)
   3. Select the **Make Wiki** option from the menu.![Discourse Wik Step 3](../../../assets/images/discourse-wiki-step-3.png)
* Update the original post when you make changes to your skill.
