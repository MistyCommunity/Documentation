Blockly is a block-based, visual programming language editor that runs in your browser.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** We recommend the following browsers for running Blockly with Misty: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge (latest versions).
{{box op="end"}}

## Blockly Controls

The following controls are available on Misty's Blockly editor.

![Blockly controls](/assets/images/menu_blockly_2.png)

* **Robot IP Address**: Enter your Misty's IP address here; you can get this value from the Misty companion app.
* **Connect/Connected button**: Indicates whether Blockly can communicate with Misty. After entering Misty's IP address, click the **Connect** button. When Misty is connected to Blockly, the button changes to **Connected**.
* **Run**: Runs the blocks on the workspace.
* **Abort**: Stops the currently running Blockly project. **Important! Abort stops the project after the current block completes and before the next block begins; it doesn't stop the actions of the current block.**
* **Save Project**: Saves the blocks on the workspace as "blockly.txt" to your computer's **Downloads** folder.
* **Show JavaScript**: Displays the JavaScript code generated by the blocks on the workspace.
* **Load Project**: Opens a saved Blockly file onto the workspace.

## Set up Blockly

Follow the steps below to set up Blockly with Misty.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** It's not generally recommended for multiple users to each use a separate instance of Blockly to connect with and send commands to a single Misty robot. If more than one person does connect to Misty at the same time, as in a class or group development environment, people will need to take turns sending commands, or Misty may appear to respond unpredictably.
{{box op="end"}}

**Important!** Blockly does not display the complete collection of Mistyâ€™s command blocks until after you establish a Wi-Fi connection between Blockly and your robot. If you notice missing command blocks, follow the steps below to make sure a connection exists between your robot and Blockly.

1. Make sure Misty and your computer are on the same Wi-Fi network and that your computer has Bluetooth turned on.
2. [Open up Blockly](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/blockly) in a browser window.
3. Enter the IP address of your robot in Blockly and click **Connect**. You can get Misty's IP address from the **Info** tab in the companion app. The **Connect** button should change to **Connected**. **Note:** If you cannot connect, double-check that Misty and your computer are on the same Wi-Fi network. If necessary, reload the page.
4. Open your browser's JavaScript console. Misty has some Blockly commands for which the results are shown in the console. For Chrome, select **View** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Console**. For Safari, go to **Preferences...**, then click the checkbox for **Show Develop menu in menu bar**, then go to the **Develop** menu and select **Show JavaScript Console**. If the Blockly controls disappear when you open the JavaScript console, select the icon in the upper left side of the page to display them again. ![Blockly window showing hamburger menu and open JavaScript console](/assets/images/blockly_js_console.png)
5. Select a simple Misty-specific block such as "ChangeEyes" (in the "Display" category).
6. Test that Blockly is set up by clicking **Run** and seeing how Misty reacts. **Note:** After clicking **Run**, there may be a short delay before Misty initially reacts. When multiple block commands are run in a row, by default there is no delay between commands. You can use the "Pause" block to add a delay between commands when running multiple commands in a row.


## Experiment with Blockly

Try the following quick "programs" to start controlling Misty with Blockly.

### Change the Color of Misty's LED

Want to change the light behind the logo on Misty's chest? Try this.

1. Choose the "ChangeLEDColor" block and click to select a color.
2. Click **Run**.

### Change the Image on Misty's Face

Are Misty's eyes looking a bit tired? Try uploading your own image to Misty's screen. It's a two-part process, but each part is very easy!

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Misty's screen is 480 x 272 pixels in size. Because Misty does not adjust the scaling of images, for best results use an image with proportions similar to this.
{{box op="end"}}

First:

1. Choose the "SaveFileToRobot" block.
2. Add the "BrowseToImageFile" block. When you click on this block, you can select an image file on your computer to upload onto Misty. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. and the maximum file size is 3 MB.
3. Click **Run**.

Then:

1. Choose the "ChangeDisplayImage" block.
2. Add the "ListFilesAvailable" block and select your file.
3. Click **Run**.


### Have Misty Play a Different Sound

Want Misty to say something new or make some noise other than her default sounds? It's another very simple, two-part process.

First:
1. Choose the "SaveFileToRobot" block.
2. Add the "BrowseToAudioFile" block. When you click on this block, you can browse for an audio file on your computer to upload onto Misty. All audio file types are valid, however Misty cannot currently play OGG files. The maximum file size is 3 MB.
3. Click **Run**.

Then:
1. Choose the "PlayAudioClip" block.
2. Add the "ListFilesAvailable" block and select your file.
3. Click **Run**.

## Locomotion Commands

Use these commands to drive Misty forward and backward, straight or in a curve, or stop.

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note:** Before using any locomotion commands, have Misty on a flat surface with plenty of room to move. It's also a good idea to experiment with small velocity values before getting her going at full speed.
{{box op="end"}}

![Misty Blockly - locomotion commands](/assets/images/blockly_locomotion_commands2.png)

### Drive
Drives Misty forward or backward at a given speed. **Important!** The "Drive" block cannot be the final block in a project. "Drive" **must** be followed by "Stop" or some other block.

When using the "Drive" command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:
* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Parameters
* LinearVelocity: A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
* AngularVelocity: A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note:** For best results when using angular velocity, first experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.


### Move
Drives Misty forward or backward at a given speed for a duration specified in milliseconds.

Parameters
* Direction: Forward or backward.
* Speed: A value from 0 (stopped) to 100 (full speed).
* Duration: A value in milliseconds, using 100 ms increments, with a maximum value of 10,000 ms (10 seconds).

### LocomotionTrack
Drives Misty left, right, forward, or backward at a given speed.  **Important!** The "LocomotionTrack" block cannot be the final block in a project. "LocomotionTrack" **must** be followed by "Stop" or some other block.

Parameters
* LeftTrackSpeed: A value for the speed of the left track, ranging from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
* RightTrackSpeed: A value for the speed of the right track, ranging from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).


### Stop
Stops Misty's movement.

Parameters
* None
