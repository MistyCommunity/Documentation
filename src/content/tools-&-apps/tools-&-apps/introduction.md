The following tools allow you to more easily interact with Misty, explore her APIs, and [build skills](../../../misty-ii/robot/introduction-to-skills).

* The [Misty App](../../../tools-&-apps/mobile/misty-app) is the simplest way to get Misty onto your local Wi-Fi network and to test out driving Misty manually.
* The [Command Center](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/command-center) provides a graphic UX that allows you to experiment with Mistyâ€™s API commands before you write any code.
* The [API Explorer](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/api-explorer) provides interactive access to Misty's REST API. Use this tool to experiment with different commands and generate code samples to use in your skills.
* The Misty [Skill Runner](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner/) web tool is a graphic interface for some of the skill-management actions that you would otherwise need to handle via a REST client.
* The [Misty Skills extension](../../../tools-&-apps/plugins-&-extensions/misty-skills-extension) for Visual Studio Code provides auto-complete, tabbed parameter entry, and information about each method in Misty's on-robot JavaScript API. It also provides basic commands for uploading, running, and stopping skills on Misty from within the Visual Studio Code editor.
* [Blockly](../../../tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/blockly) is a beginner-friendly coding tool for Misty that is ideal for kids and classroom use.
