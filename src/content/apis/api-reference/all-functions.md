You can use Misty's JavaScript API to send commands to Misty and obtain some basic data.

To [create skills](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill) for Misty, you'll typically also need to get live updating data back from Misty. For that, you need to use a [WebSocket connection](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#websocket-connections). You can visit the [Misty Community GitHub repo](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/MistyI/tree/master/Skills) for example skills in JavaScript and Python.


## Display & LED

Misty comes with a set of default "eyes" that display onscreen. But we encourage you to get creative and upload your own Misty "eyes" or other images. Misty's chest LED is also configurable.


### ChangeLED
Changes the color of the LED light behind the logo on Misty's torso.

Arguments:
* Red (byte) - A value between 0 and 255 specifying the red RGB color.
* Green (byte) - A value between 0 and 255 specifying the green RGB color.
* Blue (byte) - A value between 0 and 255 specifying the blue RGB color.

Returns:
* Success (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this call. Otherwise, false.


### ChangeDisplayImage
Displays an image on Misty's screen. Optionally, `ChangeDisplayImage` can display an image for a specific length of time and/or transparently overlay an image on Misty's eyes. Use `SaveImageAssetToRobot` to upload images to Misty.

Note that it's not possible for a custom image to overlay another custom image. Misty's eyes always appear as the base image, behind an overlay.

Arguments:
* FileName (string) - Name of the previously uploaded file containing the image to display. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3MB. To clear the image from the screen, pass an empty string ```""```.
* TimeOutSeconds (double) - Optional. The length of time to display the specified image.
* Alpha (double) - Optional. The transparency of the image. A value of 0 is completely transparent; 1 is completely opaque. When you specify a value greater than 0 and less than 1, the image appears but is transparent, and Misty's eyes appear behind the specified image.

Returns:
* Success (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this call. Otherwise, false.


### GetListOfImages

   * Location (string) - full location path of the file on the robot's file structure
   * Name (string) - the name of the image file
   * Width (integer) - the width of the image file


### SaveImageAssetToRobot
Saves an image file to Misty. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3 MB.

**Note: Misty's screen is 480 x 272 pixels in size. Because Misty does not adjust the scaling of images, for best results use an image with proportions similar to this.**

Arguments:
* FileName (string) - The name of image file to upload.
* DataAsByteArrayString (string) - The image data, passed as a String containing a byte array.
* Width (integer) - The width of the image in pixels.

Returns:
* Result (array) - Returns an array of information about the image file, with the following fields:
   * Name (string) - The name of the file that was saved.
   * Location (string) - The full path of the location of where the file is located on the robot's file system.


### DeleteImageAssetFromRobot
Enables you to remove an image file from Misty that you have previously uploaded.

**Note: You can only delete image files that you have previously uploaded to Misty. You cannot remove Misty's default system image files.**

Arguments:
* FileName (string) - The name of the file to delete, including its file type extension.

Returns:
* Success (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this call. Otherwise, false.

   * Location (string) - The full path of the location of where the file is located on the robot's file system.


## Locomotion

The following commands allow you to programmatically drive and stop Misty. If you want to directly drive Misty, you can use her [companion app](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/companion-app).

To programmatically obtain live data streams back from Misty that include movement, position, and proximity data, you can [subscribe](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#sending-commands-and-subscribing-to-websockets) to her LocomotionCommand, HaltCommand, TimeOfFlight, and SelfState [WebSockets](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#websocket-connections). To directly observe this data, you can use the [API Explorer](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/api-explorer/#opening-a-websocket).

### Drive
Drives Misty forward or backward at a specific speed until cancelled.

When using the Drive command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

```JavaScript
{
  "LinearVelocity": 20,
  "AngularVelocity": 15,
}
```

Arguments:
- LinearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- AngularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note: For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.**

Returns:
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.


### DriveTime
Drives Misty forward or backward at a set speed, with a given rotation, for a specified amount of time.

When using the DriveTime command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Arguments:
- LinearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- AngularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note: For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.**
- TimeMs (integer) - A value in milliseconds that specifies the duration of movement. Value range: 0 to 1000 ms, able to increment by 500 ms.
- Degree (double) - (optional) The number of degrees to turn. **Note: Supplying a `Degree` value recalculates linear velocity.**

Returns:
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.


### LocomotionTrack
Drives Misty left, right, forward, or backward, depending on the track speeds specified for the individual tracks.

Arguments:
- LeftTrackSpeed (double) - A value for the speed of the left track, range: -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- RightTrackSpeed (double) - A value for the speed of the right track, range: -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).

Returns:
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.
