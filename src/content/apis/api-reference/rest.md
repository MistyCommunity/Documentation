With the REST API, you can send commands to Misty from a REST client or browser.

To [create skills](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill) for Misty, you'll need to send commands to Misty and get data back from Misty. To send commands to Misty, you can call the REST or JavaScript APIs. To get live updating data back from Misty, you'll need to use a [WebSocket connection](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#websocket-connections). You can visit the [Misty Community GitHub repo](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/MistyI/tree/master/Skills) for example skills.


## URL & Message Formats

Use the following URL format when sending commands to the robot:
```markup
http://{robot-ip-address}/api/{Endpoint}
```
Misty uses JSON to format REST API data. Use this format when creating the payload:
```json
{
  "key0": "value0",
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```
All successful commands return a status and the result of the call:
```json
[
  {
    "result": true,
    "status": "Success"
  }
]
```
If there is an issue, Misty returns an HTTP error code and error message.


## Display & LED

Misty comes with a set of default "eyes" that display onscreen. But we encourage you to get creative and upload your own Misty "eyes" or other images. Misty's chest LED is also configurable.


### ChangeLED
Changes the color of the LED light behind the logo on Misty's torso.

Endpoint: POST {robot-ip-address}/api/led/change

```json
{
  "red": 255,
  "green": 0,
  "blue": 0
}
```

Parameters
- Red (byte) - The red RGB color value (range 0 to 255).
- Green (byte) - The green RGB color value (range 0 to 255).
- Blue (byte) - The blue RGB color value (range 0 to 255).

Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.


### ChangeDisplayImage
Displays an image on Misty's screen. Optionally, `ChangeDisplayImage` can display an image for a specific length of time and/or transparently overlay an image on Misty's eyes. Use `SaveImageAssetToRobot` to upload images to Misty.

Note that it's not possible for a custom image to overlay another custom image. Misty's eyes always appear as the base image, behind an overlay.

Endpoint: POST {robot-ip-address}/api/images/change

```json
{   
  "FileName": "pink_sunset.jpg",
  "TimeOutSeconds": 5,
  "Alpha": 0.5
}
```

Parameters
- FileName (string) - Name of the previously uploaded file containing the image to display. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3MB. To clear the image from the screen, pass an empty string ```""```.
- TimeOutSeconds (double) - Optional. The length of time to display the specified image.
- Alpha (double) - Optional. The transparency of the image. A value of 0 is completely transparent; 1 is completely opaque. When you specify a value greater than 0 and less than 1, the image appears but is transparent, and Misty's eyes appear behind the specified image.

Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.

## Locomotion

The following commands allow you to programmatically drive and stop Misty. If you want to directly drive Misty, you can use her [companion app](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/companion-app).

To programmatically obtain live data streams back from Misty that include movement, position, and proximity data, you can [subscribe](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#sending-commands-and-subscribing-to-websockets) to her LocomotionCommand, HaltCommand, TimeOfFlight, and SelfState [WebSockets](/onboarding/creating-skills/writing-skill/#websocket-connections). To directly observe this data, you can use the [API Explorer](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/api-explorer/#opening-a-websocket).

### Drive
Drives Misty forward or backward at a specific speed until cancelled.

When using the Drive command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Endpoint: POST {robot-ip-address}/api/drive

```json
{
  "LinearVelocity": 20,
  "AngularVelocity": 15,
}
```

Parameters
- LinearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- AngularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note: For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.**

Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.


### DriveTime
Drives Misty forward or backward at a set speed, with a given rotation, for a specified amount of time.

When using the DriveTime command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Endpoint: POST {robot-ip-address}/api/drive/time

```json
{
  "LinearVelocity": 1,
  "AngularVelocity": 4,
  "TimeMS": 500
}
```

Parameters
- LinearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- AngularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note: For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.**
- TimeMs (integer) - A value in milliseconds that specifies the duration of movement. Value range: 0 to 1000 ms, able to increment by 500 ms.
- Degree (double) - (optional) The number of degrees to turn. **Note: Supplying a `Degree` value recalculates linear velocity.**

Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns true if there are no errors related to this command.


### LocomotionTrack
