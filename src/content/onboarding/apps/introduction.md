You can easily control Misty via her apps:

* The [Companion App](../companion-app) is the simplest way to get Misty onto your local Wi-Fi network and to test out driving Misty manually.
* [Blockly](../blockly) is a beginner-friendly coding tool for Misty that is ideal for kids and classroom use.
* Misty’s [API Explorer](../api-explorer) provides a graphic UX that allows you to experiment with Misty’s API commands before you write any code.

Once you do get Misty on your network, you can also just skip straight on to [coding Misty](../../../coding/using-local-skills/architecture).
